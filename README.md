Just a little thing to experiment with rendering math equations to make fun pictures with html5 canvas.

I started messing with this to figure out webgl and maybe thinking about doing some 3d stuff in the browser. I realized that raw webgl was not pretty and it helps to use a framework.. 3js seems to popular and not hipster enough. so I found this.
